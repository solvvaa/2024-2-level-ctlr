    1. Simple graph: example

    Let's explore the basic structures of directed graphs
    in `networkx` library by creating a graph
    from [/images/example_1_simple_graph.png]

    Directed graphs are presented as instances of class `nx.DiGraph`.
    In this example, we create an empty graph first and then
    fill it with nodes and edges.

    To add one node, use `nx.DiGraph.add_node` method.
    The first argument to this method
    serves as a name of the node.

    To add an edge, use `nx.DiGraph.add_edge` method.
    The first argument is the name of the node
    from there the edge starts.
    The second argument is the name of the node
    to which the edge points.

    1. Hard graph: example

    `networkx` library allows labeling
    edges as well as nodes.

    Take a look at graph in [/images/example_2_family_graph.png].
    Notice that in this graph nodes have not only names
    but also additional properties: eyes color, age.
    To specify such properties of the node,
    pass homonymous keyword arguments to the method
    `nx.DiGraph.add_node`.

    The same applies to the `nx.DiGraph.add_edge` method.
    Notice that in the example graph edges have labels.
    To specify them, pass a `label` keyword with
    appropriate value.

    In fact, for both `add_node` and `add_edge` method
    there are no restrictions on keyword argument names,
    you can name them anything you want as long as
    you stay consistent.

    We can find isomorphic subgraphs using `GraphMatcher` instance.
