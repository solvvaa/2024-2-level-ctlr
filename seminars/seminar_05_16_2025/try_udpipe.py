    Find the path to the model and pass it as an argument.

    NOTE:
        `spacy_udpipe.load_from_path` accepts 2 arguments:
            1. language specification (for us, it is `ru` for the Russian language)
            2. path to the model as a string

    3. Adding CoNLL-U formatter

    This is a necessary step for your work with lab 6.

    To be able to produce CoNNL-U formatted annotations,
    we need to add a special pipeline to the Spacy model.

    For this, we use `add_pipe` model method, which accepts:
        1. pipe name (in our case, `conll_formatter`)
        2. configuration

    In configuration, we want to specify the following:
        - conversion map for XPOS feature: for this model, XPOS tags are not specified, so
          we want to convert empty string "" to the appropriate missing value symbol "_"
        - whether resulting ConLL-U files should include headers with sentence number and text:
          for your work, it is required that annotated files contain headers, so we specify
          this argument to be `True`

        model (spacy.Language): Language model

    Returns:
